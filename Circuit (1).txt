Circuit Diagram -
	-> In this Project, the circuit diagram is designed using the following components i.e.,
		--> Arduino UNO Board
		--> BreadBoard
		--> Two Hall Effect sensors and
		--> Two Led Lights for detection of vehicles
	-> These components are being constructed accordingly for detection of vehicles with the
	   help of these hall effect sensors.
	-> Firstly, the two hall effect sensors are connected to the arduino board for receiving
	   inputs through analog signals and gives outputs through digital signals in the Arduino
	   board.
	-> Then, the same procedure is done in the both LED lights i.e., connecting the cathode to the
	   ground of the Arduino board and Anode to the digital signal of the arduino board for blinking
	   the LED lights.
	-> These sensors are serialized with the help of breadboard because multiple circuits helps the
	   user to connect these components to the Arduino board.
	-> This can be demonstrated as whenever the vehicles are moving, then the magnetic fields
	   which are present on the engines interacts with the hall effect sensors and takes the
	   magnetic fields as an input and represents in the form of LED lights as an output which
	   alerts the trespassers to avoid crossing the roads whenever the vehicles are moving.
